# Seamfix Assessment

## Assessment Instructions
## Configure an EC2 instance on AWS noting the following:


1. **Configure an EC2 instance on AWS** with the following considerations:
2. Run a Linux or Windows operating system on this instance (more points for Linux).
3. Deploy Apache/Nginx web server to the EC2 instance.
4. Ensure that the application can be reached on this endpoint - geostore/rest through the webserver.
5. Configure AWS CodeBuild|CodeDeploy|CodePipeline** to compile this project and deploy to your EC2 instance. Building instructions can be found [here](link_to_building_instructions).

## Guidelines

- Attempt all five instructions in the order they were listed.
- Create a new AWS account to take advantage of the free tier. Set a reminder to remove your card from the account once done with the assignment, if desired.
- Submit your assignment as a Word document with the following information:

  - Access details to the EC2 instance.
  - Access details to the AWS CodeBuild|CodeDeploy|CodePipeline for review of configurations done.
  - File path to the web server installed.
  - Rationale for the web server chosen.
  - Assumptions made.
  - Summary of your thoughts on the assignment, how you approached it, and lessons learned.

Good luck!!
